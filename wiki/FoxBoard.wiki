= Introduction =

FOX Board G20 is Single Board Computer built around the ARM9@400Mhz Atmel CPU AT91SAM9G20. (http://www.acmesystems.it/?id=FOXG20)

The main fields of application are: <br>
- Solid-state web application servers<br>
- Embedded devices enhanced with Internet connectivity and Linux flexibility<br>
- Thousands of ready-to-run applications can be easily installed on the FOX Board G20 thanks to the Debian Linux distribution and its huge application repository.<br> 
- Any programming language can be used to develop your own application (read more...).<br>

= Details =

Two 40 pin sockets pich 2.54mm are available to plug the board on specific application carriers or add-on boards. On these pins 3.3 Volt signals are available which can be used to implement RS232/RS485/RS422, I2C, SPI, GPIO, A/D and PWM interfaces.<br>
<br>
A fast prototyping cabling system is also available to realize your end-user devices without without using the soldering iron or designing any custom board (Read more...).<br>
